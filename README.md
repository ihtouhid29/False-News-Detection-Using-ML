# False-News-Detection-Using-ML

The rapid rise of the World Wide Web and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter has transformed how information is shared, allowing for unprecedented levels of content creation. However, with this surge in user-generated content, misleading or false information can spread easily. Identifying misinformation or disinformation is complexâ€”even experts must consider various factors to assess an article's accuracy.

This project proposes using a machine learning ensemble approach in Python to automatically classify news articles as either real or fake. By examining distinct textual features, we train several machine learning models and combine them through ensemble methods, testing the effectiveness of this approach across four real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of our ensemble model.
